# 1. Project Overview

This project proposes an **end‑to‑end digital movie distribution ecosystem** that combines:

* Pay‑per‑view ticketing instead of subscription OTT
* Wallet‑based frictionless payments

The goal is to **outperform traditional theatrical + OTT revenue models** by enabling:

There is **no scalable digital cinema model** that:

* Preserves event‑like exclusivity
